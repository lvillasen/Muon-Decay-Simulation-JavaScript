# Muon-Decay-Simulation-JavaScript

Monte Carlo simulation of double-pulse events due to muon decays in a simple scintillation detector for educational purposes written in html/JavaScript.

A similar code written in Python can be found at https://github.com/lvillasen/Muon-Decay-Simulation.

It can be used as a complement to the code given in https://github.com/lvillasen/RedPitaya-Muon-Decay to perform the muon-decay experiment using a RedPytaya board.
